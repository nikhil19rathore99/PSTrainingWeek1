Collections:
	Is a framework in Java, which is made up of interfaces, classes and algorithms.
	In java framework, we have 2 main interfaces:

		1) Collection : (only value use case)
			List : (supports duplicate and are ordered can be accessed using index value)
				classes : arraylist, vector, linkedlist
			Set : (no duplicate values and are unordered)
				Hashset(no duplicate, unordered),
				treeset(no duplicate , sorted ordered),
				linkedhashset(no duplicate, ordered as entered by user)
			Queue : (FIFO -->  )
				using linkedlist
			Dequeue : (Both FIFO and LIFO)
				using linkedlist

		2) Map (key-value pair) :
			HashMap: no duplicate, not ordered
			TreeMap: no duplicate, sorted ordered
			LinkedHashMap: no duplicate, ordered
